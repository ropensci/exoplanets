The goal of exoplanets is to provide access to [NASA's Exoplanet Archive TAP Service](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/TAP/usingTAP.html). The functionality of this package is minimal and is simply an R interface to access exoplanet data.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/exoplanets")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to access data from the [k2names](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_k2names_columns.html) table:

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(exoplanets)

exoplanets("k2names", progress = FALSE)
```

If you wish, you can select only the columns you need: 

```{r}
exoplanets("ps", c("pl_name", "hostname"), progress = FALSE)
```

Information on the tables and columns available can be found with:

```{r}
tableinfo
```

## Capabilities

At one time, this package used the *Exoplanet Archive Application Programming Interface (API)*. Since then, a handful of tables have been transitioned to the *Table Access Protocol (TAP) service*. More tables will be transitioned to TAP and as such, this package only supports queries from TAP. For more information, you can read https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/exonews_archive.html#29April2021.
